This paper describes a method of using Bayesian statistical methodologies to provide a prior distribution of a set of estimated parameters related to a fractional order dynamical system in pharmacokinetics. This was achieved through development of a library of software which can obtained on github currently. The results of the development of this system were the ability to estimate parameters including the fractional order and initial conditions with reasonable accuracy for both dense and sparse data sets. Additionally a method of performing population level analysis was developed to allow distributions to be obtained from large sets of experimental data which also proved to work well, showing consistent results for high levels of changing noise with constant parameters.
