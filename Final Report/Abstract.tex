\begin{abstract}

This paper describes a method of using Bayesian statistical methodologies to provide a set of prior distributions for a number of estimated parameters related to a fractional order dynamical system in the field of pharmacokinetics. This was achieved through development of a library of software which can obtained on github at the provided link (https://github.com/danielmbradley/Modelling-Chemotherapeutics-For-Ovarian-Cancer-Project/). The results of the development of this system allow for the ability to estimate parameters including the fractional order and initial conditions of a provided experimental dataset with reasonable accuracy for both dense and sparse data sets. Additionally, a method of performing population level analysis was developed to allow distributions to be obtained from large sets of experimental data. This again proved to work well, showing consistent results for high levels of noise and sparse datasets provided they had constant common parameters.
