# Modelling And Administration Of Chemotherapeutics Against Ovarian Cancer

## Description
Modelling approaches for drug distribution based on ordinary differential equations fall short in light of intricate phenomena involving anomalous diffusion, deep tissue trapping, long-term accumulation effects, diffusion across capillaries, synergistic and competitive action and many more. These give rise to fractional-order pharmacokinetics.
Fractional-order dynamic equations rely on notions of fractional-order derivatives (e.g., derivatives of order 0.5); several definitions of fractional-order derivatives have been proposed in the literature. Such derivatives are used to formulate fractional-order dynamical systems which are suitable for modelling the distribution of compounds in the body.
The focus of this project will be on the development of fractional-order models for chemo-therapeutics against ovarian cancer. Relevant data have been provided by Prof Yahya Choonara (Dept of Pharmacology, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa), with whom we are involved in a collaborative research project. That said, this work can have significant implications for drug discovery.
